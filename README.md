# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview
The school board has supplied Maria with evidence of academic dishonesty, therefore, she has given us the task of upholding state-testing standards. We are to:
  1. Replace all mathh and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs.
  2. Repeat the school district analysis.
  3. Display the changes that affected the overall analysis.

## Resources
- Data Sources: students_complete.csv, schools_complete.csv
- Software: Anaconda3, Jupyter Notebook

## Results
